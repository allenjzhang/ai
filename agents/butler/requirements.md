I would like to create a butler agent that can for now connect to outlook, gmail to summarize daily digest of the inbox. Call out attention/actions needed.

Help me think it through how to break this down into iterative pieces and create a plan.md.

Requirements:

- Microsoft login, no user name/password
- Allow connect to Google gmail via OAuth
- Add unit tests
- Add e2e tests using azure openai 
- Use git and pnpm
- commit often and use discriptive commit
- Connect to Microsoft ToDO app using its API to create a main daily todo task with list of sub-tasks
- Use ESLint 9
- Add GitHub CI/CD actions that verifiy passing of the tests

Check off items in the plan as we complete tasks. If you have open questions requires my input, add those to the plan.md as well.
