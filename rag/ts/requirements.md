# Project

I would like to create a small RAG project to test.

You are a senior software developer. Help me think it through how to break this down into iterative pieces and create a plan.md. Add an markdown file to explain the RAG process in detail. Call out attention/actions needed.

Requirements:

- Use TypeScript
- Allow supply both online or local md/txt/pdf files for data
- Allow me to add additional files to be consumed
- create an interactive chat for me to test

Check off items in the plan as we complete tasks. If you have open questions requires my input, add those to the plan.md as well.
